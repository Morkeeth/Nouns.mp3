<h1> Generate AI music - Vote via Lens collect - Nounish style auction of the NFT - use it to store all your music & royalty backed Music NFTs within a ERC-6551 Token bound account! </h1>

<h2> Check out the design POC https://nounsmp3.framer.website/
 </h2>

Exploring the concept of generated AI music. Music LM by Google just got released and AI Drake has taken the charts! I want to introduce a Nounish concept with a spicy Lens governance added on top of a new way to mint and own music NFTs!

_For full transparency, I wanted to challenge myself with my first solo hack as a designer and product full-timer. The hackathon began with trying to create a Stable diffusion text->img model based on NOUNs avatars for everyone to NOUNIFY everything possible by the imagination. Falling thin on my coding experience it's been some great learnings at least._
